# Hello.

<h3>My name is Elone Hoo.</h3>

I am an student programmer and the founder of [Akatsuki](https://github.com/xiao-akatsuki) Open Source Community. Most of my work is open source and publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/xiaoxunyao). 

If you happen to speak Chinese, my Chinese name is 胡成晔 (Hú chéng yè). 

Outside of programming and finish school and get a job, I enjoy video games.
